## Answers to the questionnaire:
 - Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
 - I would have written modular code and designed the page in such a way that the web page accommodates any number of cards one for each type of cryptocurrency instead of only two.  
    
 - Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
 - No.
    
 - If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
 - I would deploy the code on multiple AWS EC2 instances and use a load balancer to route the incoming requests. 
    
 - What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
 - I would have stored images in AWS S3 bucket instead of storing it locally.
